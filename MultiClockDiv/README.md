# Multi Clock Divider

！！ Note ！！

- **This board has never actually been manufactured!** I will get feedback and improve it.
- As per the original, I designed it with 6hp.  
- To accommodate parts that are not readily available (especially in Japan), such as alphaPOT, we replaced the POT and JACK footprints with those for pin sockets.  
- Kicad's error checking may show unconnected, but you are probably fine.  
- See the HAGIWO website for the Arduino code.
