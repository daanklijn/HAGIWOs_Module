# Multi Clock Divider

！！ Note ！！

- **This board has never actually been manufactured!** I will get feedback and improve it.
- Unlike the original, the control part and the main board were combined together, so the size is 8hp.  
- Kicad's error checking may show unconnected, but you are probably fine. 
- See the HAGIWO website for the Arduino code.
