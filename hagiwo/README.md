# HGIWOs_Module

The purpose of this is to PCB the project that HAGIWO is working on.  
The Kicad project files, including the circuit and panel designs, are now available.  
I'm just starting to learn more about circuit design, so if there are any issues with the design or the circuit itself, please let me know immediately!

！！ Note ！！

- HAGIWO's project is designed to fit into a 6hp chassis, but the width of the PCB will be increased based on the Eurorack standard.
- Please note that there is no guarantee for the PCB production itself, as there are few actual PCBs that have been produced and verified.
- Please note that there is no guarantee for the PCB production itself.
- I won't go into the code here, you can find it on the HAGIWO website.
