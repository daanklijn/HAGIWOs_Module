# Hagiwo's AD633 Ring Modulator and Wave Folder module.

⚠️ This module has not been built and tested yet! 

## Some small differences compared to the orignal HAGIWO design
- Replaced 50k Potentiometers by 100k ones.
- Replaced the dual potentiometer by a single potentiometer in combination with two op-amp buffers.
